PMMP+ is a **PocketmineMultiplayer C#-Written IDE** created to write **Plugins with PHP** with the use of Systems and AI that make it easier to write them. PMMP+ supports **Co pilot** (a custom one, not GitHub co pilot), **Autocomplete Code**.

PMMP+ was first developed at July 31st, 2022. We had the idea to overtake other PHP IDEs as most are weak in their features or are paid, therefore we made a **FREE PHP IDE** with the option to support us, but of course it's **option**al ;)

## Open Source

The IDE Code will be available above the **README.md**, however not **all of the code** is public. Why? Because for us developers, there are limits to what we can show the public because we do not want people skidding our code.

The only areas public will be the ones where you're able to customize how settings work or to build in a better system of something we made in PMMP+, or to build-in an extension manually **INSIDE** the IDE.
