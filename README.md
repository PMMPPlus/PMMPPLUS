**Dragon+** is a public **df-mc (DragonFly Minecraft)** integrated development environment created to make development easier for **df-mc** developers. This IDE will be open-source, easy to use and will have a user-friendly UI. It's currently under development, and we are welcoming developers that would like to contribute to this Project.

Dragon+ was created on **17/11/2022** (replacing PMMP+ Project), using **C#** with the aim to make a user-friendly & smart development environment. This IDE will be **free-to-use** after its release, and will not require any registration when using it.

Dragon+ will also include tutorials & videos to help you out and **Docking** of items inside the IDE to make it simpler to use.

## Open Source

There are no limits to what you can do with the source code, however we encourage you do not **infect** it with malware. Of course, you can create a pull request and merge your changes (If we do accept them), but they have to actually **update** Dragon+ rather than ruin it.

Infectious merges will not be accepted.

## Contribution

Current contributors: **Pronner**
